# Eyes-colour-sensitivity-measurer.
For now we can measure and log sensitivity to &lt;lightness> of 400x400 rectangles. In principle it is enough to accumulate data on one's natural colourmetric system's capabilities and attributes. E.g. for further analisys.

Don't forget to:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

_(requires PyQt6)_

"So we decided to finally accumulate measurements on the characteristics of our color-recognition visual natural system. 
Where do we start?...".

And that's how I made this dirty script.

Tested on Windows 10 Pro with **Python 3.10.9.**

Start the app(script), then just press "LEFT ARROW" or "RIGHT ARROW" to select the rectangle that seems brighter to you (in fact I mean the one with the greatest LIGHTNESS among two, scientifically speaking).

I will (probably) add more game modes later.

Enjoy.
